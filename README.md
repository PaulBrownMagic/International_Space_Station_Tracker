# International_Space_Station_Tracker
Tracks the location of the International Space Station and displays the flag of the country.

Requires country-flags images available on github here:
https://github.com/hjnilsson/country-flags.git

Also, need to add an image for sea.png in the PNG folder. Here's a CC0 licenced image that can be scaled to 260x260px:

Other python dependancies are:
requests, geopy, pygame.

Fun little thing to just leave running in the background while working.
